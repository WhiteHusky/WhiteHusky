### Carlen White (AKA WhiteHusky)

I'm a jack-of-all trades software developer who makes occasional contributions to repositories for software I use if I have the know-how and time to do so.

This account is primarily focused on making contributions to NSFW repositories and other software that might not look well on me in a professional context, unless the professional context requires me to do NSFW things then *Hi. You have to work at an interesting company to need this kind of people who are comfortable with stuff like this.*
